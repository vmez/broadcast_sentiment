# broadcast_sentiment

The dataset contains data from 3 USA broadcasts, focusing on 13 shows that made reference to Climate Change between 2009 and 2017.
The objective was to analyse the differences or similarities between MSNBC, CNN, and Fox News and the general sentiment they conveyed to their audience about climate change.

This excercise helped me learn how to work with the tidytext package; special attention was made to try different communication perspectives.
